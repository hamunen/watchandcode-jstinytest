  /*
  The copyWithin() method shallow copies part of an array to another location in the same array and returns it, without modifying its size.

  Parameters:
    - target: Zero based index at which to copy the sequence to.
    - start (optional): Zero based index at which to start copying elements from. 
    - end (optional): Zero based index at which to end copying elements from


  Return: The modified array.

  REQUIREMENTS:
  - If no start or end and target zero, returns unchanged array
  - If target is positioned after start, the copied sequence will be trimmed to fit arr.length
  - If target negative, target will be counted from the end.
  - If target is at or greater than arr.length, nothing will be copied. 
  - If negative, start will be counted from the end.
  - Copies up to but not including end
  - If negative, end will be counted from the end.
  - If start is omitted, copyWithin will copy from the start (defaults to 0).
  - Modifies the original array
